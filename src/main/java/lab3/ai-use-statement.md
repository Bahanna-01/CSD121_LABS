# AI Use Statement

I used ChatGPT in study & learn mode to help me better understand the lab requirements, organize my code, and improve my documentation. The AI supported my learning in the following ways:

- Understanding how to structure the project into classes and packages
- Learning how to validate user input like `1 1` and `1,1` using regular expressions
- Writing beginner-friendly comments and JavaDoc-style documentation
- Creating a developer journal that reflects my learning process
- Preparing an AI Use Statement that follows academic guidelines

I used AI only to learn and improve my understanding. All code was written and tested by me.
